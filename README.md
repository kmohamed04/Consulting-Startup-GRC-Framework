Consulting Startup GRC Framework

This project builds a security and compliance framework for a small IT consulting startup with limited staff and limited budget. The goal is to help the company understand risks, protect client data, and create a simple governance structure. The project uses Excel for the risk register and Power BI for dashboards that track risk levels, control status, and compliance. The framework aligns with NIST CSF and CIS Controls.
